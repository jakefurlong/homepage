# Jake Furlong ‚Äî Personal Homepage

This is my personal, static website built with HTML, CSS, and a neon-styled cyberpunk aesthetic. It showcases my projects, contact links, and a bit about who I am. The site is designed to be fast, responsive, and visually distinct ‚Äî built from scratch without frameworks or server-side code.
